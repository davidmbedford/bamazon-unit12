# Bamazon: The CLI Store-front
This app uses a CLI to provide a stripped-down online storefront. 

### What it does
This app has two components:
1. Bamazon Customer
   * This component is for users interested in purchasing items through the application. Upon start, they will be displayed with a full stock list and asked what they would like to buy, and how much.
   * items purchased will be deducted from the inventory. If there is insufficient stock, the customer will be notified.

2. Bamazon Manager
   * This component is for company managers. Upon start, they will be given for options.
     1. The option to view all products.
     2. The option to view all low inventory (stock below 5).
     3. The option to increase the quantity of a specific product.
     4. The option to add a completely new product to the inventory.
